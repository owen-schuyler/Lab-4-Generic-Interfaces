/**
 * A generic stack interface. A stack is a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
 * push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
 * The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out).
 * Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
 * The stack is a linear data structure, and the order of elements is maintained by the stack.
 *
 * @defines size: max number of elements the stack can hold
 *          self: the stack
 *
 * @constraints size > 0 AND 0 <= |self| <= size
 *
 * @initialization_ensures an empty stack is created with a max number of elements the stack can hold equal to size
